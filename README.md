# 🌌 Soul Mosaic

**Soul Mosaic** is a narrative-driven action-adventure game where emotions shape the world.

## 🎮 Game Core

- **🧩 Emotional Biomes**  
  Five distinct realms themed around **Rage**, **Clarity**, **Terror**, **Ecstasy**, and **Grief**, each with unique environments, enemies, and mechanics.

- **🧠 Dynamic Boss Fights**  
  Each boss adapts based on your playstyle. Outsmart Clarity, survive Rage, or confuse Terror—every emotion requires a different strategy.

- **🌀 Powers of the Soul**  
  Unlock emotion-based powers as you collect Soul Fragments. Use them in combat or puzzle-solving: **dash through fear**, **burn through lies**, or **command obedience**.

- **🎭 Rich Storytelling**  
  Discover the protagonist's fractured past through atmospheric cutscenes and NPC encounters, each reflecting aspects of human emotion and trauma.

- **🎨 Aesthetic & Vibe**  
  Inspired by games like *Hollow Knight* and *Ori*, with painterly 2.5D visuals, dynamic lighting, ambient soundscapes, and symbolic art direction.
